\section{Introduction}

These are some basic instructions on installing MOOSE on the Duke Compute Cluster\footnote{\url{https://rc.duke.edu/dcc}} (DCC). Hopefully, they are detailed enough such that users with limited Linux experience are able to get up and running with minimal assistance. However, if something is unclear, or if issues arise while following these instructions, feel free to reach out for assistance on the \mintinline{text}{#cluster} channel on Slack.
